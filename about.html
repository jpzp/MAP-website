      <h3>Michael Perez</h3>
      <h4>Producer, Writer</h4>
      <p>
        Michael is originally from sunny Miami, Florida. He moved to Los Angeles to study at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts, earning a BFA in Writing for Screen & Television. Now he works as a freelance producer, helping writers and directors hone their material and fostering their work to its full potential. He operates under the business entity “Neon Cartography Productions” because his goal is to help you navigate your production to success.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fan of unique worldbuilding and characters, Michael works primarily in the genre and LGBTQ+ spaces. He enjoys uplifting stories with lots of heart as those are the narratives that inspired him to enter this industry in the first place. He is also committed to queering the screen by helping his teammates develop characters of diverse cultures, sexualities, genders, abilities, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The projects Michael has produced span a variety of mediums including short films, music videos, and even video games. His most successful short “Crazy Car” was screened at the Hollyshorts Film Festival and is distributed online by ALTER, where it currently holds over 50,000 views. Another short film he produced, “I Think I’m Gay” is being distributed through UK-based NQV Media and is due to release on Amazon Prime in late 2020.  While working on these shorts, Michael also produced Way of the Wolf, an indie video game that has now been downloaded over a thousand times on itch.io, a website for independently-made games. You can find the entirety of his work as well as links to each project under the <a href="works.html">“My Works"</a> tab.
