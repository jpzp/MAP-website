    <p class="about-text">
      I’m originally from Miami, Florida. I moved to Los Angeles to study at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts, earning a BFA in Writing for Screen & Television. Now I work as a freelance producer, helping writers and directors hone their material and fostering their work to its full potential. I operate under the business entity “Neon Cartography Productions” because my goal is to help you navigate your production to success.

    <p class="about-text">
    I’m a huge fan of unique worldbuilding and diverse characters, so the projects I take on are generally in the genre and LGBTQ+ spaces. I enjoy uplifting stories with lots of heart as those are the narratives that inspired me to enter this industry in the first place. I am also committed to queering the screen by helping my production partners develop characters of diverse cultures, sexualities, genders, abilities, and more.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      The projects I have produced span a variety of mediums including short films, music videos, and even video games. My most successful short “Crazy Car” was screened at the Hollyshorts Film Festival and is distributed online by ALTER, where it currently holds over 60,000 views. Another short film I produced “I Think I’m Gay” is being distributed through UK-based NQV Media and is due to release on Amazon Prime in late 2020. These are just a small sample of my portfolio, though. You can find the entirety of my work as well as links to each project under the <a href="works.html" id="worksLink">“Works” </a>tab. Thanks for visiting!
