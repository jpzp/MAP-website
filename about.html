      <h3>Michael Perez</h3>
      <h4>Producer, Writer</h4>
      <p>
        Michael is originally from sunny Miami, Florida. He moved to Los Angeles to study at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts, earning a BFA in Writing for Screen & Television. Now he works as a freelance producer, helping writers and directors hone their material and fostering their work to its full potential. Michael works primarily in the genre and LGBTQ+ spaces. He enjoys stories with lots of worldbuilding and heart as those are the narratives that inspired him to enter this industry in the first place. He is also committed to queering the screen by helping his teammates develop characters of diverse cultures, sexualities, genders, abilities, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Michael has produced several projects across a variety of mediums including short films, music videos, and even video games. His most successful short “Crazy Car” was screened at the Hollyshorts Film Festival and is distributed online by ALTER, where it currently holds over 50,000 views. Another short film he produced, “I Think I’m Gay” is being distributed through UK-based NQV Media and is due to release on Amazon Prime in late 2020.  While working on these shorts, Michael also produced Way of the Wolf, an indie video game that has now been downloaded over a thousand times on itch.io, a website for independently-made games. You can find the entirety of his work as well as links to each project under the “My Work” tab.

        When he’s not producing, Michael enjoys picking up more hobbies than he can count. He’s a particularly skilled baker with a penchant for cookies. He’s also a competitive ballroom dancer, having won several first-place awards at dance competitions across California. His newest interest is trapeze, and he is currently training at a circus school with the hopes of one day performing his own original routine.
